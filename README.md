# 🏦 Smart Assistive ATM System for Blind and Visually Impaired Users

A final-year engineering project built to revolutionize banking accessibility for the blind and visually impaired. This system leverages **Arduino Mega**, **OpenCV**, **Python**, and **Embedded C** to provide a secure, tactile, and voice-guided ATM interface.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This assistive ATM prototype features:

- 👁️‍🗨️ **Face Recognition** for secure, contactless login
- ⠿ **Braille-style Keypad** for tactile input
- 🔊 **DF Player Audio Module** for real-time voice guidance
- 🖥️ **LCD Interface** for visual feedback (for partially sighted users or assistants)
- 🔧 Powered by **Arduino Mega 2560**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Enable **independent ATM use** by blind users
- Enhance **security** with OpenCV-based face authentication
- Integrate **tactile Braille feedback** using servo motors
- Provide **voice-assisted navigation** throughout ATM operations

## 🚀 How It Works
👤 User is recognized via facial recognition (OpenCV)

🔡 User inputs desired transaction via tactile Braille buttons

🧠 Arduino processes the input and controls output mechanisms

🔊 DF Player provides step-by-step voice guidance

📊 LCD displays visual feedback for admins/partially sighted

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
🔐 Fingerprint or iris authentication

🗣️ Voice command interface

🌐 Cloud integration for remote monitoring

🗺️ Multilingual voice support
